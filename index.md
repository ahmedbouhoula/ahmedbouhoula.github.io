## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="karel.jpg">

Hi! I am a computer science PhD candidate at ETH Zurich. My supervisor is [David Basin](http://people.inf.ethz.ch/basin/), who leads the [Information Security Group](https://infsec.ethz.ch/). Here is my [resume.pdf](https://karelkubicek.github.io/resume.pdf).

## Research Interest

Web privacy: Internet develops fast, but the users' needs are overlooked, namely privacy. Regulations like the GDPR are trying to fix that, but their enforcement is lacking behind. I try to address this lack of enforcement by developing automated techniques for privacy compliance analysis, or by directly blocking web elements to preserve user privacy.

Symmetric cryptanalysis: In the past, my focus was in applied cryptography. I studied how statistical testing can automate analysis of cryptoprimitives.
