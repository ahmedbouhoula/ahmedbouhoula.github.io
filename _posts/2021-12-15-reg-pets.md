title: "Automating Cookie Consent and GDPR Violation Detection"
abstract: "The sending of marketing emails is regulated to protect users from unsolicited emails. For instance, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive requires that marketers must obtain users' prior consent, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) specifies further that such consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

Based on these requirements, we design a labeling of legal characteristics for websites and emails. This leads to a simple decision procedure that detects potential legal violations. Using our procedure, we evaluated 1000 websites and the 5000 emails resulting from registering to these websites and we make both datasets and evaluations available upon request. We find that 20.6% of the websites contain potential privacy violations, either in the registration process (17.3%) or email communication (17.7%). We demonstrate with a statistical analysis the possibility of automating the detection of such violations."

# Checking Websites' GDPR Consent Compliance for Marketing Emails

**Authors: Karel Kubicek <karel.kubicek@inf.ethz.ch>, Jakob Merane, Carlos Cotrini, Alexander Stremitzer, Stefan Bechtold, and David Basin**

**Abstract:** *The sending of marketing emails is regulated to protect users from unsolicited emails. For instance, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive requires that marketers must obtain users' prior consent, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) specifies further that such consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.*

*Based on these requirements, we design a labeling of legal characteristics for websites and emails. This leads to a simple decision procedure that detects potential legal violations. Using our procedure, we evaluated 1000 websites and the 5000 emails resulting from registering to these websites and we make both datasets and evaluations available upon request. We find that 20.6% of the websites contain potential privacy violations, either in the registration process (17.3%) or email communication (17.7%). We demonstrate with a statistical analysis the possibility of automating the detection of such violations.*
